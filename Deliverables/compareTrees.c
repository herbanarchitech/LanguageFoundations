/* As you cross a forest you can't help but admire the nature around you including the many species of trees. Despite tour interest , you are very unskilled botanist and have a lot of trouble identifying different tress. A friend gives you some guidance and you decide to write a program that will give you the name of the tree based on its charactereistics.
 *
 * There are gour toes of trees:
	* The "Tinuviel" is 5 meters high or less and its leaves composed of 8 or more leaflets 
	* The "Calaelen" is 10 meters high or more and its leaves are composed of 10 or more leaflets 
	* The "Falarion" is 8 meters high or less and its leave are composed of 5 or fewer leaflets 
	* The "Dorthronion" is 12 meters tall or more and its leaves are composed of 7 or fewer leaflets 
	*
Your program should read the height and the number of leaflets of a given tree (both integers) , and should be able to determine and display the name of corresponding tree. If the height and number of leaflets does not match any of the tree types descriptions , your program should display "Uncertain"
